When runniong orBot and OrWall on Rooted device:
it only recieved one Sip request at 08:26 the morning after.

When running orbot on a rooted device over night, recieved ICMP messages from 174.128.228.68 (Denver, Nevada). From 17:16 to 18:32 and 09:09 to 13:47 But nothing in between there.  
It also recieved Sip:request OPTIONS from 17.57 to 18:14 and from 06:12 to 13:17
A (Trying)100@129.241 â€¦
It also recieved a DNS query from 80.82.64.213(NetherlandsAmst) at 10:26 for http://www.cpsc.gov/.
Also UDP from 71.6.135.131.
At 00:13 it recieves SYN,ACK from 192.185.147.130 (Houston), and again at 02:18:32 and 05:46. It also recieves SYN requests the whole time. 


As expected running just orbot does not hide anything other than your browsing. 







 ... .112 No root. Orbot and  apps

Leaks DNS all day

ip.src==129.241.205.112 and not (ip.addr==167.114.66.61 or ip.addr==188.166.121.237 or ip.addr==5.189.153.185)

After two days sends out to 216.58.209.110

but ater that back to tcp over tor.

Does get syn and syn,ack from 96.41.47.209 and 43.229.53.89 after beeing inactive for a long time


ip.addr==129.241.205.112 and not ( ip.addr==167.114.66.61 or ip.addr==5.189.153.185 or ip.addr==188.166.121.237 or ip.addr==5.189.153.185)



ORWall freeses the chrome app when it is not woring.


	OrBot Root does not leak when loggin on and off networks or switching between.

 

When running orbot with apps proxying it as expected leaks DNS queries. 

When opening the webbrowser after two days SYN/SYN,ACK/HTTP GET and ack was sent outside Tor.
But then it started communication over Tor again ( We cannot be sure what that communication was).
